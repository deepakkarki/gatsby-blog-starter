# About these interviews

These interview transcripts are source material for an ongoing book project about the history of WordPress. They have been carried out with people involved with the WordPress project from its inception over ten years ago, and those who have been instrumental in shaping both WordPress itself, the wider project, and the community. 

The transcripts can be seen (converted to HTML) alongside their original MP3 interview recordings at http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/.
