This is a series about computer history intended primarily for computer people. While there is a lot of writing out there about the history of computing for a general audience, there is much less for a technical audience â€” which is a shame, because there are so many interesting historical questions that might only occur to somebody who designs and builds software every day, questions like Where did JSON come from? and Why are man pages still a thing?
