We live in a highly networked world where billions of people engage and interact with one another online. People connect on social media, communicate using applications, and build websites using everything from hand-coded CSS and HTML to content management systems.

WordPress is the user-focused publishing platform built to make it easy for anyone to publish online. It poweres almost 30% of all websites, and is used by millions of people worldwide. With so much of the internet powered by WordPress, it's no surprise that the people who use it are as diverse as those who use the internet itself. **This series tells the story of WordPress**, a tool created by a couple of hackers and developed by volunteers from all over the world.
