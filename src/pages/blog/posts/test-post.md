# 1. Welcome to StackEdit!

Hi! I'm your first Markdown file in **StackEdit**. If you want to learn about StackEdit, you can read me. If you want to play with Markdown, you can edit me. Once you have finished with me, you can create new files by opening the **file explorer** on the left corner of the navigation bar.


# 2. Files

StackEdit stores your files in your browser, which means all your files are automatically saved locally and are accessible **offline!**

## 2.1 Create files and folders

The file explorer is accessible using the button in left corner of the navigation bar. You can create a new file by clicking the **New file** button in the file explorer. You can also create folders by clicking the **New folder** button.

## 2.2 Switch to another file

All your files are listed in the file explorer. You can switch from one to another by clicking a file in the list.


# 3. Publication

Publishing in StackEdit makes it simple for you to publish online your files. Once you're happy with a file, you can publish it to different hosting platforms like **Blogger**, **Dropbox**, **Gist**, **GitHub**, **Google Drive**, **WordPress** and **Zen-desk**. With [Handlebars templates](http://handlebarsjs.com/), you have full control over what you export.

> Before starting to publish, you must link an account in the **Publish** sub-menu.

## 3.1 Publish a File

You can publish your file by opening the **Publish** sub-menu and by clicking **Publish to**. For some locations, you can choose between the following formats:

- Markdown: publish the Markdown text on a website that can interpret it (**GitHub** for instance),
- HTML: publish the file converted to HTML via a Handlebars template (on a blog for example).

## 3.2 Update a publication

After publishing, StackEdit keeps your file linked to that publication which makes it easy for you to re-publish it. Once you have modified your file and you want to update your publication, click on the **Publish now** button in the navigation bar.

> **Note:** The **Publish now** button is disabled if your file has not been published yet.


## 3.3 SmartyPants

SmartyPants converts ASCII punctuation characters into "smart" typographic punctuation HTML entities. For example:

|                 |ASCII                          |HTML                         |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Single back ticks|`'Isn't this fun?'`            |'Isn't this fun?'            |
|Quotes           |`"Isn't this fun?"`            |"Isn't this fun?"            |
|Dashes           |`-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash`|-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash|


## 3.4 Code highlighting

This is some python

```python
import this
print "hello world"

def loop():
  for i in range(1,100):
    print i
```
