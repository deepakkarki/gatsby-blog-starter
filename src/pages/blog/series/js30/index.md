JS30 is a series based off Wes Bos's [JS30 video course](https://JavaScript30.com/friend/DISCOVERDEV). The spirit of the course is to help learners learn javascript by building small apps from scratch - without any library or frameworks.

I've written 30 blog posts in the series - one for each video/tutorial. Each post details the whole tutorial and has the embedded video + the code pen of the starter files and finished files. Also included are the relevant links to the MDN docs.
