/**

 URL schemes
 ===========

 * /blog/ --> index page for the blog. (a .js file - auto converted)
    This will have the overall listing of the series, categories, posts, etc.
    This needs the posts & pages, series & categories (with thier posts under them)
    Pages are markdown (or .js?)  files which are not posts, i.e. they donâ€™t appear in the feed.
    Posts are... well, blog posts that is supposed to appear in the feed.
    The series variable will hold the series under this sub blog along with the posts belonging to each series.


 * /blog/posts --> index page for the blog post listing
    This needs to display all the posts within the sub-blog. Also support pagination.
 * /blog/posts/2 --> pagination of the blog post listing
 * /blog/posts/pname --> a specific blog post


 * /blog/series --> index page of all the series in the (sub)blog
    Needs all series and all the posts under each series. Also do pagination.
 * /blog/series/sname --> listing of all the posts in this series
 * /blog/series/sname/2 --> (optional) pagination of the listing in a series
 * /blog/series/sname/pname --> a specific blog post


 * /blog/categories --> index page for the category 
    Needs all the categories in the sub blog and posts in the categories
 * /blog/categories/cname --> listing of all posts in this category
 * /blog/categories/cname/2 --> pagination of the listing in a category


 MarkDown 
 ========

 For the markdown use custom element support (at least <a> --> <Link> for internal links)
 - https://using-remark.gatsbyjs.org/custom-components/ (look at the caveats)
 - https://prestonrichey.com/blog/react-in-markdown/ (look at <hidden/>)


 Collections (TODO)
 ===========

 What I haven't tackled is collections (kinda like in jekyll) where it is all related
 but unlike a blog post / series. 
 Eg. projects I've built, book reviews, etc. Can't assign a category since it's not 
      part of the blog stream, nor is it just "pages". (like /about, /contact)

exports.onCreateNode = ({ node, getNode, actions }) => {
  const { createNodeField } = actions

  /**
   Need to add some more metadata to the nodes so querying becomes easier.
   (maybe fileType - page or post, sub-blog name, etc)
   */

  if (node.internal.type === `MarkdownRemark`) {
    // as of now the slug mirrors the filesystem, but ideally I should pick this up 
    //  from the config. Custom url schemes and what not.
    const slug = createFilePath({ node, getNode, basePath: `pages` })
    createNodeField({
      node,
      name: `slug`,
      value: slug,
    })
  }
}


/*
 Page Creation
 =============

 So now this should mirror the output of the URLs I expect.
 * /blog/ - create the index page. => auto since it's .js files.
    this will have to do the query for posts, pages, series, collection itself.
 * /blog/(page) - like /about, /contact and stuff - this should be done via the
    standard markdown remark rendering I will be doing.

 * blog/posts/[n] - this I have to paginate, filter the nodes via query and then
    send them to templates/post-index.js, do this in a loop (posts/2, /3, etc)
    Can I somehow add some specific data to be rendered (at top or whatever?)
 * blog/posts/pname - this is should be part of the generic markdown remark processing.

 * blog/series - This will be an index.js file just like blog's index.js. Again, 
   just run the query inside the .js file. Or have template/series-index.js?
   Could come in handy for future pagination if required.
 * blog/series/sname/[n] - this is again paginated. So again loop and render a template file
    Again worth noting if I can have an index.md file or something that can add specific
    data or context to the page being rendered. (explaining a bit about the series)
    (XXX : actually this isn't required? how many posts can there be in a series anyway)
 * blog/series/sname/pname - this should be part of the generic markdown remark processing

 * /blog/categories - Again this will be an index.js file, query what it needs.
 * /blog/categories/cname/[n] - pagination. Loop and render a template file.
    again, would be good if I can have a little custom data per category. 

  NOTE : In case of custom data for paginated entries, I can't have an index.md file,
  eg. "blog/categories/systems/index.md" as this will be rendered during markdownRemark
  processing. So unless I deal with this somehow during 'onCreateNode', this will be a mess.
  Other alternative is that I can have this in the site metadata.

/*
NOTE: `generateFromMDX` is not used as of now, due to this stupid warning message.

warning The GraphQL query in the non-page component "/Users/deepakkarki/Desktop/portfolio/src/templates/mdx-post.js" will not be run.
Exported queries are only executed for Page components. Instead of an exported query, either co-locate a GraphQL fragment and compose that fragment into the query (or other fragment) of the top-level page that renders this component, or use a <StaticQuery> in this component. For more info on fragments and composition, see http://graphql.org/learn/queries/#fragments and for more information on <StaticQuery>, see https://gatsbyjs.org/docs/static-query

Apparently this warning should come in when a template is never used, 
and even though I did use it in gatsby-node.js, it doesn't seem to recognise, I guess mostly because
the stupid plugin auto processes anything under pages/, so if I move the mdx file to components, there is no problem
